## androidtest

This repository contains a Gradle project that automatically compiles the sources and runs the tests of the other Cryptimeleon libraries via Android.
It supports running those tests as unit tests or as instrumentation test on a connected Android device.

The currently tested libraries are as follows:
- [Cryptimeleon Math](https://github.com/cryptimeleon/math)
- [Cryptimeleon Craco](https://github.com/cryptimeleon/craco)
